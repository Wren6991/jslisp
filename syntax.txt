[structure]

list::= lparen {number|id} rparen

when executing code:

- code is stored as lists
- if first item of list is id, retrieve that function and execute it on the cdr.
- otherwise, throw error.
- value of evaluated function is passed up, becomes argument to previous expression.
- function arguments are evaluated recursively. e.g.
	(print (+ 1 2))
	-> (print 3)
	==> 3


If a list's car is non-null, its cdr is non-null (i.e. every list ends with an empty list item)

If a list's car is null, its cdr is also null.
